This files are the data from experiments from the publication https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c04169 .

The archive data2DIR.zip contains the experemental 2DIR intenseties for different acetamide/water mixing ratios.

The Thz directory contains files with the intensities of the THz spectra of DES systems with different acetamide/water mixing ratios
and the average of the spectra in the range from 0.1 to 1.0 Thz.
